# software-quality-hackathons
A guide to help design and run hackathons where some improvements take a while to measure. To help everyone interested in this topic we will sometimes use a specific project - PocketCode - as an example.

## Context of the hackathons
We would like to use these hackathons to be a catalyst for helping contributors improve various aspects of the software quality of - typically - a specific project (e.g. PocketCode).

The software is likely to already exist and have active users. There will be at least one source of analytics that records and reports aspects of the software such as installs, active sessions, etc. The source(s) provide data to the project team which may augment and complement other sources of information such as test results, static analysis, code metrics, etc.

## Objectives
Ideally the hackathon will include some immediate measures of progress and improvements; in practice some of the measurements will be of a longer term nature, such as improvements in the crash rate once a new version of the software has been released and is being used in the field.
